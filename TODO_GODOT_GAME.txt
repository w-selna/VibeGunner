TODO for Godot C# Circle Shooter Game:

1. Create a new Godot project and enable C# support.
2. Add a Node2D as the root node of your main scene. Name it 'Main' or similar.
3. Add a Node2D as a child of the root node. Name it 'Player'.
4. Attach the Player.cs script to the Player node.
5. Design the Player node to look like a circle (e.g., add a Sprite or draw a circle in _Draw).
6. Create a new scene for the projectile:
   - Add a Node2D as the root, name it 'Projectile'.
   - Attach the Projectile.cs script to it.
   - Design the projectile's appearance (e.g., small circle or sprite).
   - Save the scene as 'Projectile.tscn'.
7. In the Player node, assign the 'Projectile.tscn' to the 'ProjectileScene' export variable in the Inspector.
8. Set up input actions in Project Settings > Input Map:
   - 'ui_up', 'ui_down', 'ui_left', 'ui_right' for movement (if not already present).
   - 'mouse_left' for shooting (bind to left mouse button).
9. Add the Player node to the main scene and run the game.
10. Test and tweak as needed (e.g., speed, visuals, collision, etc.).
