MVP NEXT STEPS: (no particular order)
- Add enemies/targets to shoot at (endless zombies from all directions)
   - Randomly select from 1 of 100 possible point from the edge of the screen to come in from
   - Movement is towards the player with some jitter.
   - Zombies are 1 hit kill (for now).
- Implement enemy spawning mechanic (Linearly scaling faster spawning as the game goes on)
   - Starts at like 1 zombie per second and increases every 10 seconds (test this scaling rate)
   - No maximum number of zombies on the screen
- Implement game over conditions (you get touched at all you die)
   - Does not need to be fancy, just within a few pixles.
   - Death scene displays score and button to start again.
- Add collisions (bullets hitting enemies, you getting touched by an enemy)
   - Bullets disappear on hit. 
- Implement scoring tracking system (number of kills in top corner)
   -add timer in the other top corner from kill count.
- Better visuals, scaled correctly/realistically.
   - for scale, a bullet might just be a small black dot 2x2 pixles.
   - A player and zombie might only be 20 - 50 pixles tall.
   - add hit animations
   - multiple zombie looks
   - Adjust all speeds (bullets, player, zombie) to feel correct in absolute terms and relative terms.
